# Experimental Data

Answer the challenges in the "Simulator Description" section using experimental data:

+ Task_1 (Problem 3.73 in Smith *et al.*, 2017 - Use temperature as a state property. Answer in m3/kg): Estimate the volume change of vaporization for ammonia at 20°C. At this temperature the vapor pressure of ammonia is 857 kPa.
+ Task_2 (Problem 5-48 in Çengel *et al.*, 2019 (**Figure 1**) - Use pressure as a state property. Answer in MW): Steam flows steadily through an adiabatic turbine. The inlet conditions of the steam are 4 MPa, 500°C, and 80 m/s, and the exit conditions are 30 kPa, 92 percent quality, and 50 m/s. The mass flow rate of the steam is 12 kg/s. Determine the power output.

+ Task_3 (Example 7-3 in Çengel *et al.*, 2019 (**Figure 2**) - Use pressure as a state property. Answer in kJ/K): A rigid tank contains 5 kg of refrigerant-134a initially at 20°C and 140 kPa. The refrigerant is now cooled while being stirred until its pressure drops to 100 kPa. Determine the entropy change of the refrigerant during this process.
