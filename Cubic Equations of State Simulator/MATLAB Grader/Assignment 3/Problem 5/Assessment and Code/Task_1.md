# Task_1 = Reference Solution?

The volume change of vaporization is formulated as $\mathbf{v_{fg}=v_g-v_f}$. This task can be solved using the "Temperature" tab and "Experimental Data" option in "Two Phases in Equilibrium.xlsm" (**Figure 3**). Temperature unit conversion to K can be done in the "Extra" tab (**Figure 4**). With this result, it can be determined that using the predictions with the Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state we obtain a percentage error of less than 3% compared to using experimental values, concluding that the result with the simulator is very close to the expected real experimental behavior.
