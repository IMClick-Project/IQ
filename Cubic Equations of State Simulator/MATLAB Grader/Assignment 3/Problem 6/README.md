# Fugacity Test

Answer the following problems using the simulator results with the Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state:

+ Task_1 (Problem 6.31 in Smith *et al.*, 2017 - Answer in kJ): A vessel of 2 m3 capacity contains 0.02 m3 of liquid water and 1.98 m3 of water vapor at 101.33 kPa. How much heat must be added to the contents of the vessel so that the liquid water is just evaporated?
+ Task_2 (Example 16-7 in Çengel *et al.*, 2019 - Answer in BTU/lbm): Calculate the value of the Gibbs function for saturated refrigerant-134a at −30°F as a mixture of liquid and vapor with a quality of 30 percent.
+ Task_3 (Example 10-1 in Çengel *et al.*, 2019 (**Figure 1**)): Consider a steam power plant operating on the simple ideal Rankine cycle. Steam enters the turbine at 3 MPa and 350°C and is condensed in the condenser at a pressure of 75 kPa. Determine the thermal efficiency of this cycle.
