# Task_2 = Reference Solution?

Temperature unit conversions can be found in the "Extra" tab. The temperature can be registered in the simulator database so that the properties of the saturated state are obtained through the simulator with the options "Two-Phase Envelope on a PV Diagram", "Two-Phase Envelope on a PH Diagram", and "Two-Phase Envelope on a PS Diagram". These results can be used in the "Temperature" tab and "Fugacity Test" option in "Two Phases in Equilibrium.xlsm". **Figure 3** shows a guide to the use of "EoS_Simulator" to calculate the thermodynamic properties necessary to solve this problem.
