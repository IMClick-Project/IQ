# Task_3 = Reference Solution?

It will be assumed that steady operating conditions exist and kinetic and potential energy changes are negligible. We note that the power plant operates on the ideal Rankine cycle. Therefore, the pump and the turbine are isentropic, there are no pressure drops in the boiler and condenser, and steam leaves the condenser and enters the pump as saturated liquid at the condenser pressure. Therefore, the state 1 is specified by $\mathbf{P_1}=$ 75 kPa and $\mathbf{x=0}$; state 2 by $\mathbf{P_2}=$ 3 MPa and $\mathbf{s_2=s_1}$; state 3 by $\mathbf{P_3}=$ 3 MPa and $\mathbf{T_3=}$ 350Â°C; and state 4 by $\mathbf{P_4}=$ 75 kPa and $\mathbf{s_4=s_3}$. Also, from energy balances it is known that $\mathbf{q_{in}=h_3-h_2}$ and $\mathbf{q_{out}=h_4-h_1}$. Finally, $\mathbf{\eta_{th}=1-\frac{q_{out}}{q_{in}}}$.

Pressure and temperature unit conversions to bar and K, respectively, and energy unit conversion factor can be found in the "Extra" tab. The pressures can be registered in the simulator database so that the properties of the liquid, vapor, and saturated state are obtained through the simulator with the options "Isobar given Pressure on a TV Diagram", "Isobar given Pressure on a TH Diagram", "Isobar given Pressure on a TS Diagram", "Two-Phase Envelope on a TV Diagram", "Two-Phase Envelope on a TH Diagram", and "Two-Phase Envelope on a TS Diagram". These results can be used in the "Pressure" tab and "Fugacity Test" option in "Two Phases in Equilibrium.xlsm" and "One Phase.xlsm". **Figure 4** shows a guide to the use of "EoS_Simulator" to calculate the thermodynamic properties necessary to solve this problem.
