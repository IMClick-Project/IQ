# Task_10 = Reference Solution?

The enthalpy of vaporization represents the amount of energy needed to vaporize a unit mass of saturated liquid at a given temperature or pressure. This is equal to $\mathbf{h_g-h_f}$. The data needed to solve the problem is found in the refrigerant 134a experimental data table (**Figure 13**).
