# Task_2 = Reference Solution?

The entropy of saturated vapor hydrogen at a temperature of 25 K is 37.6649 kJ/kgÂ·K, so the state of aggregation of hydrogen described in the question is vapor, since the entropy is greater than in saturated vapor. This task can be solved using the "Isotherm given Temperature on a PS Diagram" (**Figure 21**) option.
