# Task_1 = Reference Solution?

The entropy in saturated liquid and saturated vapor methane is 4.8151 and 9.4393 kJ/kgÂ·K, respectively, so the methane of the task is in saturated liquid-vapor mixture $(\mathbf{s_f\leq s\leq s_g})$. Quality $\mathbf{x}$ has significance for saturated mixtures only and, using the entropy, this is equal to $\mathbf{\frac{s_{avg}-s_f}{s_{fg}}}$. This task can be solved using the "Isobar given Pressure on a TS Diagram" (**Figure 19**) or "Two-Phase Envelope on a TS Diagram" (**Figure 20**) options.
