# Task_3 = Reference Solution?

The entropy of saturated liquid argon at a pressure of 9.107 bar is 1.6872 kJ/kgÂ·K, so the state of aggregation of argon described in the question is liquid, since the entropy is less than in saturated liquid. This task can be solved using the "Isobar given Pressure on a TS Diagram" (**Figure 22**) option.
