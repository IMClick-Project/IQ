# Task_4 = Reference Solution?

The enthalpy of saturated liquid nitrogen at a temperature of 120 K is 5.1965 kJ/kg, so the state of aggregation of nitrogen described in the question is liquid, since the enthalpy is less than in saturated liquid. This task can be solved using the "Isotherm given Temperature on a PH Diagram" (**Figure 24**) option.
