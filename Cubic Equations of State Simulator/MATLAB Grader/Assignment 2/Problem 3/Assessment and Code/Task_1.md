# Task_1 = Reference Solution?

The enthalpy of saturated vapor ammonia at a pressure of 3.81 bar is 491.7461 kJ/kg, so the state of aggregation of ammonia described in the question is vapor, since the enthalpy is greater than in saturated vapor. This task can be solved using the "Isobar given Pressure on a TH Diagram" (**Figure 19**) option.
