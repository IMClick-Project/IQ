# Task_4 = Reference Solution?

The volume of saturated vapor oxygen at a temperature of 70 K is 7.0586 m3/kg, so the state of aggregation of oxygen described in the question is vapor, since the volume is greater than in saturated vapor. This task can be solved using the "Isotherm given Temperature on a PV Diagram" (**Figure 22**) option.
