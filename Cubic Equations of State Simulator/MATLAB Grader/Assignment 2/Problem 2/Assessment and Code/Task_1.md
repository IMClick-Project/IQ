# Task_1 = Reference Solution?

The volume of saturated liquid chlorine at a pressure of 32.17 bar is 0.00097733 m3/kg, so the state of aggregation of chlorine described in the question is liquid, since the volume is less than in saturated liquid. This task can be solved using the "Isobar given Pressure on a TV Diagram" (**Figure 18**) option.
