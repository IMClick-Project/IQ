# Task_3 = Reference Solution?

The density is the reciprocal of the specific volume, that is, $\mathbf{\rho=\frac{1}{v}}$. The saturation pressure of nitrogen at a temperature of 95 K is 5.4312 bar. The nitrogen pressure in the problem is greater, therefore the phase is liquid. This task can be solved using the "Isotherm given Temperature on a PV Diagram" (**Figure 21**) option.
