# Task_7 = Reference Solution?

The saturation pressure of carbon dioxide at a temperature of 275 K is 48.6831 bar. The carbon dioxide pressure in the problem is greater, therefore the phase is liquid. This task can be solved using the "Isotherm given Temperature on a PV Diagram" (**Figure 27**) option.
