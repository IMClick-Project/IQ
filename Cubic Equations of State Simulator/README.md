# Cubic Equations of State Simulator

**By: Mariola Camacho Lie, Rodrigo Alberto Hern√°ndez Ochoa, & Adriana Palacios Rosas**

This repository contains the material provided in the MATLAB Grader course entitled "Cubic Equations of State Simulator", which explains the development and application exercises of the **EoS Simulator**. This application, made in MATLAB, performs calculations and diagrams/surfaces of thermodynamic properties of a pure substance through the cubic equations of state. If you want to have access to the course, send an email to mariola.camachole@udlap.mx.
