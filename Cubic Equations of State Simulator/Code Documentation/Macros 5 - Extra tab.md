# "Extra" tab

In this spreadsheet, it is possible to carry out three options (**Figure 1**): 

+ Manually write the data to perform linear interpolations of up to ten properties. The numerical values ​​corresponding to the closest inferior and superior to the base data for the calculations are entered.
+ Show some important constants with different units to solve problems related to the thermodynamic properties discussed in this course.
+ It has twenty forms to perform unit conversions. Each type of conversion has a table of conversion factors, where each unit in row $\mathbf{i}$ contains the factors to pass to the unit in column $\mathbf{j}$, for example, **Figure 1** shows that an amount in units of $\mathbf{ft/s^2}$ has to be multiplied by 0.3048 to obtain this quantity in units of $\mathbf{m/s^2}$, that is, 1 $\mathbf{ft/s^2}$=0.3048 $\mathbf{m/s^2}$. On the right side of each table is the form to make conversions of a certain unit. For example, in **Figure 1** in cell G19 the original unit is selected, in cell F19 the magnitude is written, in cell G20 the desired unit is selected, and in F20 the answer is obtained. In the lower part from this is the conversion to the other types of units.
